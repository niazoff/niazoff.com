Shnayim provides a whole new way to complete [*shnayim mikrah vechad targum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shnayim_mikra_ve-echad_targum). Jewish law dictates to read the weekâ€™s Torah portion twice and its *targum*, translation, once. Sometimes it can be difficult to keep track and quite easy to lose your place. Shnayim solve all your issues by helping you track your progress, save specific verses, add notes and more all in a simple, easy to use and beautiful interface.
