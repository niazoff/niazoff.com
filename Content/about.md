#  About
Hey, 👋🏻 I'm Natanel, an iOS developer from NYC and welcome to my site where you'll find posts mostly about my experiences with [Swift](https://swift.org/about) but possibly regarding my other interests including traveling, 🏔 Judaism, 🕍 espresso, ☕️ design 🖌 and electric longboarding. 🛹 My site was also built in Swift using [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell)'s amazing static site generator [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) and makes use of the beautiful [Sofia](https://www.motyfo.com/fonts-library/sofia-pro) typeface. I would love to hear from you at [@niazoff](https://twitter.com/niazoff) or via [email](mailto:nniazoff@icloud.com).
